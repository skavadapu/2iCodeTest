Scenarios/Assumptions:

		 * Let user input 10 numbers ranging from 1 to 100
		 * Read 10 numbers ranging from 1 to 100
		 * Display error when more than 10 values entered by user
		 * Display error when values entered not between 1 and 100 by user
		 * Display output after removing the duplicate and in reverse order


Tech stack used: Java, Eclipse IDE, Git/GitHub vcs

Solution Steps:  

1. Take the input from the user using Scanner object
2. Validate the data and throw the error when not meeting the criteria
3. Keep the user input in ArrowList
